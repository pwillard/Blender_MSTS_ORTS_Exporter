# README

This latest update adds a Blender 4.1 release `crudely` patched to deal with breaking changes in the Python API for this version of Blender and beyond. (Most other existing addons have made this same change as well) 
	
Use the exporter with 4_1 in the name if you are using Blender 4.1, all other older versions of Blender (from 2.8+)  will continue to use original Add-On file.
